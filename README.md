# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Example - PHP

## Building the example

* Clone this git repository
* Navigate to Lab6 and run <code>docker-compose build && docker-compose up</code> Note this may take a couple minutes the first time. It will be faster on subsequent executions since docker will cache the packages that the php container uses.
* Copy the code from 'malicious.php' into an html file on your host computer.

## Demo Process

* Open a browser on your host computer and browse to http://VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_IP/ and fill out the form  with username='user' and password='password'

* On the "motd" page, submit a text string to set the "message of the day".

* Observe the value set on the new page.

* On your local machine, load the malicious.html file and change the <code>src</code> attribute of the img take to point to the IP address of your virtual machine.

* Load the malicious.html file on your host machine. This will simulate visiting a page on a separate domain which exploits the CSRF vulnerability.

* Navigate back to http://VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_IP/motd.php and observe the change.

# Remediation

* Add a hidden form element to index.php. The hidden form element's value should be a random number (try using <code>bin2hex(openssl\_random\_pseudo\_bytes(16, TRUE))</code>). Save that random number to a session variable as well.

* When the form is received by the index page, validate that the session variable you saved and the hidden form element are identical. Only then should you set the cookie.

* Verify the protection works by trying to load the malicious html page again.
